Congratulations!</p><p>The first thing we should go over before the grammar is the spelling and phonology (organization of sounds and syllables) of the language.  Remember that spelling and pronunciation are exactly the same thing, only expressed in different mediums, in Lojban.</p><aside>Lojban can be expressed in many ways, including Elian Script, but people almost always use the Latin alphabet.  Easy to type, easy to read, easy to use.</aside><p>Lojban uses most of the letters of the Latin alphabet, and most are pronounced similarly, but some are different.  In addition, <span class="i">h</span>, <span class="i">q</span>, and <span class="i">w</span> are never used.</p><p>Lojban has exactly six vowel sounds, <span class="i">a</span>, <span class="i">e</span>, <span class="i">i</span>, <span class="i">o</span>, <span class="i">u</span>, and <span class="i">y</span>.  In English, a single vowel letter can represent many different vowel sounds, some overlapping, (English <span class="i">a</span> can be pronunced like in "ape", "apple", or "father") but in Lojban this is not the case.  Here is a table:</p><table><tr><td>a</td><td>f<span class="b">a</span>ther, m<span class="b">a</span>rk (not as in c<span class="b">a</span>t)</td></tr><tr><td>e</td><td>g<span class="b">e</span>t, m<span class="b">e</span>t</td></tr><tr><td>i</td><td>mach<span class="b">i</span>ne, m<span class="b">ee</span>t</td></tr><tr><td>o</td><td>b<span class="b">o</span>ld, m<span class="b">o</span>re</td></tr><tr><td>u</td><td>t<span class="b">u</span>lip, c<span class="b">oo</span>l</td></tr><tr><td>y</td><td>b<span class="b">u</span>t, <span class="b">uhh</span>, tr<span class="b">u</span>st</td></tr></table><br class="space"><aside>Fun fact: You don't hear <span class="i">y</span> that often.  This is because <span class="i">y</span> is usually only used as a "verbal hyphen"- that is, it's used to create spacing between consonants that would otherwise be unpronounceable in compound words.  Elsewhere it only occurs in names.</aside><p>Vowels can slide from one another like so:</p><table><tr><td>ai</td><td>h<span class="b">igh</span></td></tr><tr><td>au</td><td>h<span class="b">ow</span></td></tr><tr><td>ei</td><td>h<span class="b">ey</span></td></tr><tr><td>oi</td><td>b<span class="b">oy</span></td></tr><tr><td>ia</td><td>hi-<span class="b">yah</span>!</td></tr><tr><td>ie</td><td><span class="b">ya</span>y</td></tr><tr><td>iu</td><td class="b">you</td></tr><tr><td>ua</td><td><span class="b">waah</span>!</td></tr><tr><td>ue</td><td>q<span class="b">ue</span>stion</td></tr><tr><td>uo</td><td>q<span class="b">uo</span>te</td></tr><tr><td>ui</td><td><span class="b">we</span>, French <span class="b">oui</span></td></tr></table><br class="space"><aside>Don't worry, when you scroll a bit further down you'll see I have some recordings of spoken Lojban that will make this easy to hear and remember.</aside><p>Instead of "sh", Lojban uses <span class="i">c</span> to create the same sound.  To make an English "ch" sound, you write <span class="i">tc</span>.  <span class="i">c</span> never makes a sharp "k" sound.  Lojban <span class="i">g</span> always makes the sound of "<span class="b">g</span>um" and not "<span class="b">g</span>em".  <span class="i">j</span> always sounds like "mea<span class="b">s</span>ure" or French "bon<span class="b">j</span>our".</p><p>Now, <span class="i">x</span> is a little bit different.  It's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_velar_fricative">only consonant</a> that English doesn't really have.  Germans use it all the time, and the same sound is actually used in the musician Ba<span class="b">ch</span>'s name.  It sounds kind of like the sound people make when they say "ble<span class="b">ch</span>" when they don't like some food- you narrow the back of your tongue so the air makes sound when it gets forced through.</p><aside>It's seriously no big deal at all if you can't pronounce <span class="i">x</span> right now.</aside><!--not messing with jade to reduce those--><p>The very last thing about pronunciation is symbols!  Lojban uses <span class="b i">'</span> (apostrophe), <span class="b i">.</span> (period), and <span class="b i">,</span> (comma, used extremely rarely).  Lojban doesn't have punctuation in the way English does, and symbols are really no different than letters in that they are pronounced too just like anything else.</p><p>The period expresses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottal_stop">glottal stop</a>, the same sound a British person uses when they say "bu<span class="b i">'</span>er" instead of "butter".  Lojban uses the glottal stop when a word begins with a vowel and not a consonant.  The apostrophe in Lojban is basically no different from English <span class="i">h</span>.  Lojban <span class="l">.a'a</span> (we are using {} to quote lojban from now on) sounds no different from English "Aha!".  However a word in Lojban can <span class="i">never</span> start with <span class="b i">'</span>.  The apostrophe considered a separator of two vowels into two syllabes.  Lastly, the comma is used exclusively in names when someone wants to be explicit that a vowel slide is two syllables (such as how "Stewart" is two syllables).</p><aside>AKA, Lojban <span class="l">.stu,yrt.</span> = English "Stewart".  Name-words in Lojban always end in consonants and are surrounded by glottal stops.</aside><p>Now, here's some recordings for you to listen to.
