If you've arrived at this page, it's probably because you're curious about Lojban.</p><p>Being curious is good.  It isn't a binding obligation to invest a lot of time in something.  It's simply a healthy desire to be informed.  The goal of this chapter is to explain what Lojban is and its philosophy without teaching you how to actually use it. Think of this as a crash course on what Lojban is and nothing else.</p><aside>While the community over in IRC as well as the Google Group would love to meet new people with an interest in the language, it isn't important just yet.</aside><p>Now, <span class="i">what is Lojban, exactly?</span></p><p>Lojban is a constructed language.  This means it was deliberately developed by a group of individuals instead of gradually coming into being spontaneously in the way natural languages do.  In Lojban, there is no grammatical ambiguity.  Every valid statement has one and only one possible grammatical structure.  Because of this, a formal grammar can be constructed, and there now exist programs that can parse Lojban sentences.  The Lojban IRC channel has a bot named <span class="i">camxes</span> which we can input sentences and it will immediately return a parse tree for what you gave it.</p><p>Part of Lojban's philosophy is having the ability to be as specific or as vague as you want.  In Lojban, if you want to go eat somewhere, you could equally say <span class="i">"Want restaurant-move."</span> (this is an approximate English translation) or <span class="i">"Can we go to a restaurant soon?"</span> I envision this tutorial to be similar in that you can continue as far as you wish, but not be left unaware of the broad picture if you close the browser after the first page.</p><aside>This applies to tenses and plurality, as well.  Lojban, by default, does not specify tense, gender, or whether something is plural.  Most simple information like this is a single syllable to specify.</aside><p>Lojban has a <a>small dictionary</a> of about 1300 root words.  These root words also can be combined to form more complex concepts.  The vast majority of all compound words are made from just two root words, and often compound words aren't needed and root words will simply suffice.  Every definition follows a very specific format.</p><p>Due to the design of Lojban, even with a relatively small amount of knowledge of grammar, one can express a great deal of concepts.  In addition, the grammar can be taught in modular steps very easily without leaving anything out.</p><aside>Once you learn tanru, rearranging arguments, and abstractions, you can basically say almost anything you want to, though of course there exist many additional features of Lojban, many that make it more efficient to use.</aside><p>Finally, Lojban has no irregularities in spelling.  There is no difference in expression between writing and speaking; there is a one to one map between Lojban spelling and spoken syllables.</p><p>Do you wish to learn a bit more about Lojban?  If so, the <a href="chapter1.html">next chapter</a> is open to you.</p><div class="auto dnav"><div class="fright tright"><a href="chapter1.html">next</a><div class="small">The sounds of Lojban</div></div></div></div></body></html>
